  <h3>How do materials effect Loudness</h3>
  <p>How loud somthing is can be easally effected by both the material it hits this is a sumary of what happens to the DB level for different materials.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Here are the materials we going to go over:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Metal</li>
    <li>Pillows</li>
    <li>Foam</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Starting with the metal, this can actually make a room louder. This is due to sound's property; reverberation. this means that when a wave hits a surface, the wave can get rid of some of the waves energy and begin vibrating itself. metal is esspecialy suseptable to to this and on top of that when it vibrates it also vibrates the air causing sound.</p>

  <p>Next up is the pillows. these can possibly lower the sound but it doesent work well. pillows trap sound in thier microscopic holes, keping it captive untill the vibrations have turned into heat.</p>
  <img src="" alt="how pillows work">
  <p>Finally we have foam, this is like a pillow, hoever it is desined so that is covers more surface area, and thusly can convert more sound.</p>
