  <h3>How do materials effect Loudness</h3>
  <p>How loud somthing is can be easally effected by both the material it hits, and the material it pasees through this is a sumary of what happens.</p>
  <p>Here are the materials we going to go over:</p>
  <ol>

    <li>Solid bumpy object</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Starting with the smooth object, as sound passes through the material it becomes muffled. while sound moves fast through a solid due to its density, this is also its down fall. becuase sound moves in pressure waves, a ridged object like a solid</p>
