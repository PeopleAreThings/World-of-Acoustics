  <h3>How does the shape of a room affect the way sound travels within it?</h3>
  <p>What happens when sound hits a wall, what are echos, & how can we get good accoustics.</p>

  <h3>How does the shape of a room affect the way sound travels within it?</h3>
  <p>Well, sound bounces a bumpy room can cause it to diffuse and become quiter. somtimes like in an eliptical room speaking from a focal point can cause you to be able to hear anything at the other focal point.</p>

  <h3>What Cuases Echos</h3>
  <p>I think we have all an echo at some point. Echos are cuased by the bouncing of sound waves.</p>

  <h3>How can the design of a room be optimized for good acoustics?</h3>
  <p>Rooms can be desined for good acousics. For example, if you want to make a speech (or evesdropping) set up make an eliptical room and place the listeners on one focal point and the speaker on the other this ensures that the listnener can hear the speaker no matter what way they face.</p>
